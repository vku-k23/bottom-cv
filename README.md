# System Overview
- Purpose: Job search platform allowing users (employers/recruiters) to search, post, and apply for jobs.
- Main Functions: Job posting, job searching, application submissions, user authentication, file uploads for images/resumes.
# Component Diagram
- Frontend (ReactJS): User interface for all interactions.
- Backend (Spring Boot): Handles business logic, API endpoints, authentication, file processing.
- Database (MySQL): Stores user data, job posts, applications.
- File Storage (AWS S3): Stores user-uploaded images and files.
- Deployment (Docker on AWS EC2): Containerized services running on a single EC2 instance.
- CI/CD Pipeline (Jenkins): Automates build, test, and deployment processes.
- Source Control (GitHub): Manages codebase and integrates with Jenkins.
- Monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana): Collects and visualizes system metrics.
# Technology Stack
- ReactJS: Modern, scalable frontend framework.
- Spring Boot (Java): Robust backend framework for RESTful APIs.
- MySQL: Reliable relational database for structured data.
- AWS S3: Scalable, secure file storage.
- Docker: Containerization for consistent deployments.
- AWS EC2: Flexible cloud infrastructure.
- Jenkins: Automated CI/CD for frequent deployments.
- GitHub: Source code management and collaboration.
- Swagger: Interactive API documentation.
- Jira: Project management and issue tracking.
# Data Flow
- User interacts with React frontend.
- Frontend communicates with Spring Boot backend via REST APIs.
- Backend processes requests, interacts with MySQL for data, and AWS S3 for file storage.
- Responses sent back to frontend for user display.
# Deployment Architecture
- Docker containers for frontend and backend services.
- Containers deployed to a single AWS EC2 instance.
- MySQL and Prometheus also containerized.
- AWS S3 used for persistent file storage outside containers.
# CI/CD Workflow
- Developers push code to GitHub.
- Jenkins listens for changes, pulls code, builds Docker images, runs tests, and deploys containers to EC2.
- Deployment is triggered on every commit (continuous deployment).
- Jenkins updates Jira tickets based on build and deployment status.
# API Documentation
- Swagger integrated with backend for automatic API documentation.
- Documentation accessible via dedicated endpoint on the backend service.
# Security Considerations
- HTTPS enforced for all communications.
- JWT-based authentication for user sessions.
- Credentials and secrets managed securely (e.g., environment variables).
- Permissions enforced for user roles.
# Scalability
- Docker containers enable horizontal scaling if needed.
- AWS S3 provides scalable file storage.
- Architecture supports scaling out with more EC2 instances in the future.
# Monitoring & Logging
- Prometheus collects metrics from services.
- Grafana dashboards provide real-time system monitoring.
- Centralized logging configured for troubleshooting and audits.
